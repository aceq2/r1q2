Hello!  
I ask that if you copy any code into your own engine that you please  credit
me  and include  a link  to the  R1Q2 homepage.  Where possible,  please be
specific about which features you have used from R1Q2.

If  you fork  R1Q2 in  any way  please modify  the build  string to  clearly
indicate  that it  is a  fork. I  would appreciate  notification before  you
release any public forks of R1Q2 so I can check them out. Thanks.
